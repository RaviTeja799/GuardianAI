# GuardianAI

GuardianAI is an advanced AI-driven content moderation system designed to preprocess, detect, and manage harmful content efficiently. Built with a modular architecture, it leverages Python Cloud Functions, a React frontend, and integrations with Google Cloud services like Pub/Sub and BigQuery to provide a scalable and robust solution.

## Overview

This project aims to streamline content moderation workflows by combining preprocessing, detection, actioning, and review summarization into a cohesive system. It is ideal for platforms requiring real-time content analysis and automated decision-making.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes and prepares content for analysis.
- **Harmful Content Detection**: Identifies harmful content using AI-driven logic.
- **Actioning**: Automatically applies moderation actions based on detection outcomes.
- **Review Summaries**: Generates concise summaries for human reviewers.
- **Feedback Loop**: Collects training feedback to refine detection models.
- **Scalability**: Built on Google Cloud for high availability and performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (for Cloud Functions)
- Node.js 16+ (for React frontend)
- Google Cloud SDK
- Google Cloud project with Pub/Sub and BigQuery APIs enabled
- Git

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaviTeja799/GuardianAI.git
cd GuardianAI
```

### Set Up Environment Variables
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` with your Google Cloud project ID, credentials, and other required variables.

### Install Dependencies
- **Cloud Functions**:
  ```bash
  cd cloud-functions
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

## Deployment

### Deploy Cloud Functions
Run the deployment script or deploy manually:
```bash
cd scripts
./deploy_functions.sh
```
Alternatively, deploy each function individually:
```bash
gcloud functions deploy preprocess_content --runtime python39 --trigger-http
gcloud functions deploy detect_harmful_content --runtime python39 --trigger-http
# Repeat for other functions
```

### Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Configure Google Cloud Services
- **Pub/Sub**: Create topics and subscriptions in `pubsub/`.
- **BigQuery**: Initialize tables using schemas in `bigquery/`.

## Usage

1. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed URL).
2. Trigger content moderation workflows via HTTP requests or Pub/Sub events.
3. Monitor logs and data in the Google Cloud Console.

### Notes for Usage
- **Clipboard Ready**: Copy the entire block above and paste it directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub.
- **Flowchart Placeholder**: Replace `[Placeholder for Flowchart]` with a link to an actual flowchart image (e.g., `![Flowchart](docs/flowchart.png)`) after uploading it to the `docs/` directory.
- **Customization**: Update placeholders like `[your-email@example.com]` and add specific details (e.g., exact API keys or deployment URLs) as needed.
- **Side Headings**: The README uses Markdown headings (`##`) for clear section separation, enhancing readability.
